Additional material:

  * A good way to visualize the transverse Mercator projection over the entire global is using [ tm-grid.kmz](tm-grid.kmz),
which is a Google Earth KML file showing the transverse Mercator grid (in red) for the WGS84 ellipsoid with grid spacing
1000 km in the _x_ and _y_ directions. The scale, _k_ = 0.9998035, has been adjusted so that the distance from the equator
to a pole is 10000 km.  
If you open the "tm-grid" folder in Google Earth and check on the "spherical-transverse-mercator" subfolder, you will
also see the corresponding spherical transverse Mercator grid (in yellow) conformally mapped to the WGS84 ellipsoid.
(This doesn't have a constant scale on the central meridian.)

Use only the entries with latitude â‰¥ 0 for testing an algorithm with the standard convention for the branch cut.

  * Maxima implementation of Lee's exact method (arbitrary precision): [tm.mac](tm.mac) and [ellint.mac](ellint.mac). There is brief documentation at the top of tm.mac. 
  * The paper gives Kruger's series accurate to 8th order;
